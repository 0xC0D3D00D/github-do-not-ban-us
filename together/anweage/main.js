 * Since the very first day of the internet, those in power in Iran have tried to monitor, control, and even block
 * people's online activities. An ever-growing focus on censorship, filtering, and content moderation has resulted
 * in alternatives that are being used only by those in power inside Iran to spread the word of propaganda among
 * Iranians. These mediums (including, but not limited to: Aparat video service -- a "safe alternative to YouTube,
 * Bale and Soroush messengers -- "safe" alternatives to Telegram and other foreign messengers) are being represented
 * to the people as "better" alternatives since they provide any information, block any unwanted access, and apply
 * any degree of content moderation in favour of those in power. In other words, the act of filtering and censorship
 * is now replaced by content moderation through monitoring and surveillance facilities provided by these alternative
 * services. With a few exceptions, one can say: it is the Iranian surveillance capitalism.
 * 
 * Now GitHub and Microsoft are acting against ordinary Iranian people. The obvious consequence of this discrimination
 * is the unfortunate consensus of people and the developers who live and work inside Iran, that there is a real
 * "threat to Iranian people" by foreign countries.
 * Of course, there are many other online version control systems and tools that are available for Iranian
 * users, but limiting access to the foremost popular tool for Iranian developers would only add to the flames
 * of a false unification of people and government against "the foreign enemy".
 * 
 * There is no so-called "enemy". Instead of making it uglier, human beings must work collectively, not individually
 * or in groups or in specific countries, towards a peaceful and prosperous world. This discrimination, although
 * abiding by the "rule of law", is yet another step towards dehumanization, an act exercised by every single
 * demagogue throughout history. And the bad news is that obviously, this act will also be used by Iranian demagogues
 * within the Iranian propaganda system to justify the Iranian government's disinformation about the "foreign enemy".
 * Just like those in power in Iran, who by "the rule of law" have been discriminating against the Iranian people and are
 * using "libertarian theology" to justify their brutal actions, the U.S. is also spreading the flames of dehumanization
 * in the name of "freedom" and "pursit of happiness". If we do not educate ourselves well enough, this dehumanization
 * will continue until the time comes in which we will only consider "the lack of war" as peace. And this alone, is the
 * biggest trap that we can fall into.
 * 
 * We must not make mistakes; by only writing this, starring, and forking repositories, this act will not be stopped.
 * This discrimination, unfortunately, will go on. But as humans, it is incumbent upon all of us to keep our eyes open
 * so that the ugly world of politics and power will not stop us from stepping towards a united, peaceful, and a
 * prosperous world.
